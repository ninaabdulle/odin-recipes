# odin-recipes

This is my first project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), where I built a simple website to practice basic HTML skills.  

The site contains a main index page with links to 3 recipe pages. Each recipe includes a description, ingredients list, and step-by-step instructions.  

## Features
- Basic HTML structure
- Multiple linked pages
- Use of headings, lists, images, and links

## Lessons Learned
- Structuring a website with multiple pages
- Using relative links for navigation
- Organising content with headings, lists, images, and links


This was part of the Foundations Course in The Odin Project
